The main objective of this research is to build a model determines whether cancer is present in 
an MRI image or not. We developed and trained a model that could identify the tumor, 
providing a quick and easy method for helping to segment and identify brain tumors without 
the use of manual labor. This approach would save lives and be more efficient.
