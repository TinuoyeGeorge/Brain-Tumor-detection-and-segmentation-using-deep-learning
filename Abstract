# Brain-Tumor-detection-and-segmentation-using-deep-learning
This research focuses on brain tumor detection and segmentation using Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNN) with architectures of Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and VGG16. The 
central purposes of this research include image preprocessing, data augmentation, feature 
extraction, image segmentation, and image classification. 
The dataset imported for this project consists of brain MRI images, which were preprocessed 
to improve the overall image resolution. Data augmentation techniques were applied to 
heighten the variability and volume of the training data. For feature extraction, CNN models 
were utilized, specifically the VGG16 architectures. This model was trained on a preprocessed 
dataset to learn the important features associated with brain tumor presence. Image 
segmentation was performed to precisely outline and identify the tumor region within the brain 
images. FCN architecture was employed for this task, which allowed pixel-level classification 
of tumor regions. Finally, image classification was carried out to group brain images based on 
the absence or presence of a tumor. The trained models were evaluated using accuracy, 
precision, recall and F1score as the performance metrics.
The results of the project demonstrated promising outcomes, achieving an accuracy score of 
93% and a precision, recall and f1score ranging from 75% to 100% based on the specific type 
of tumor enlisted. This indicates that the developed CNN models, with the FCN and VGG16 
architectures, effectively detect and segment brain tumors from MRI images. The findings of 
this study contribute to the field of medical image analysis and gives a foundation for further 
research and development in brain tumor diagnosis and treatment.
I recommend the use of more deep learning algorithms for the process of detecting brain tumor.
